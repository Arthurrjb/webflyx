This repository contains a collection of exercises I completed while learning Git through the online platform boot.dev. 
It serves as a practical space where I explored and practiced fundamental Git concepts such as initializing repositories,
creating commits, working with branches, merging changes, interacting with remote repositories, and rewriting history using
commands like rebase and reset. 
The goal of this project is to build confidence with real Git workflows and version control best practices.
